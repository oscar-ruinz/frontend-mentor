## My process

### Built with
- HTML - CSS

### What I learned

By doing this challenge with the template on Figma, I learned this property to make a single border for each table row.

```css
table{
    border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

### Continued development

I am resuming my study and practice of CSS. I had abandoned it and honestly didn't remember how much I enjoy doing this. My goal is to continue steadily on this path to find a job in this field.
