## My process

### Built with
- HTML - CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this challenge with the template on Figma, I learned how to define a complete font style in a variable.

```css
:root {
  --text-preset-1:  800 24px / 150% "Figtree", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I am resuming my study and practice of CSS. I had abandoned it and honestly didn't remember how much I enjoy doing this. My goal is to continue steadily on this path to find a job in this field.
