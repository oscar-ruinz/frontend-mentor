### What I learned

By completing this challenge, I learn how useful it is to define a maximum width in containers when using percentages for the width property.


### Continued development

I am resuming my study and practice of CSS. I had abandoned it and honestly didn't remember how much I enjoy doing this. My goal is to continue steadily on this path to find a job in this field.
